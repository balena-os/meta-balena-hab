        The new secure boot setup involves:

        * Program SRK efuses and reboot
        * Check there are no HAB events
        * Then close the device and reboot so the new OTPMK keys take effect
        * Then program and encrypt disks

        We have extended the padding for all artifacts in order to accomodate
        the same IVT offset in all existing device trees.

      body: |
        In order to authenticate device trees, U-boot needs to store the IVT
        offset as an environment variable.

        By extending the padding we make it so that all device trees up to
        certain size locate the IVT header at the same offset, hence only
        requiring a single U-Boot environment variable to hold it.

        The current padding has been choosen to accomodate all current device
        trees but in future it may need to be expanded if bigger device trees
        are used.

      body: |
        When booting a flasher initramfs it's assumed the user wants to
        reprogram.

        Corrupt the internal encrypted disks at the earliest to prevent exploits
        originating from running an authenticated flasher image.

        Erasing the whole disk would be more effective but time consuming, so we
        trade-off erasing the initial sectors of each partition and the
        partition table to at least make recovery very painful.

        When closed, HAB locks the job ring and DECO master ID registers by
        default.

        This commit changes the CSF descriptor to:

        * Leave Job Ring and DECO master ID registers unlocked (MID)
        * Leave RNG state handle 0 uninstantiated, do not generate
          descriptor keys, do not set the AES DPA mask, and do not
          block state handle 0 test instantiation. (RNG)
        * Do not keep manufacturing protection private key in CAAM internal
          memory. (-MFG)

        This allows a locked device to initialize and use the CAAM.

      body: |-
        * Configure u-boot with HAB and secure boot support
        * Extend the FDT load address in u-boot's environment to allow the
        loading of larger kernel initramfs bundles
        * Allow to specify the IVT offset for HAB authentication of artifacts
        in the u-boot environment. This allows to authenticate Linux initramfs
        bundles, and in future device tree files, instead of just plain kernel
        images.
